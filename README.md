# Tracker
I designed a Study Tracker "Responsive" website using HTML5, CSS3 and bootstrap.
I embedded google fonts, linked my css file and bootsrap in head section. I added some icons from "fontawesome.com" so linked it in head section.
I created a navbar in body using bootstrap and it contains: my brand name(Study Tracker), contact, sign in and sign up.
On viewing my website on smaller screen, contact, sign in and sign up goes inside a hamburger menu and you can see them on clicking the menu. Navbar toggler feature is used here.
On clicking sign in and sign up, a form pops up which is created using bootstrap. The code is written below footer section.
Now I added a title and 2 buttons. The title is left aligned for larger screen like laptop and becomes center aligned for smaller screen like ipad mini or iphone.
Then I added features section with some icons and text.
Then I added footer where I used various social media icons.
Now, the 2 sign up and sign in form code is placed.
I styled my html using css and the web site is quite attractive.
I have used comments in my files so that everyone can understand my code.
